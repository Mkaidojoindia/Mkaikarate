      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        At MKAI Karate (Meishin Karate Association of Integrity), we believe
        that Karate is more than a martial art—it is a way of life guided by
        integrity, truth, and honesty. Our mission is to empower students to
        embrace discipline, maintain physical and mental fitness, and develop
        strong character that reflects the principles of Meishin both inside and
        outside the dojo. By blending traditional techniques with modern
        training methods, MKAI Karate shapes confident, respectful, and
        resilient individuals who live by the values of honesty, integrity, and
        perseverance, carrying the true spirit of Karate into every aspect of
        their lives.

        {/* SKAI_Kolathur branch was started in 2011 by Sensei K. Manikandan (4th
        Dan, KIO - National Judge) under the guidance of Shihan B. Duraivelu,
        with the mission of promoting Karate as a way of life. SKAI_Kolathur is
        a proud branch of the Shuhari Karate Association of India (SKAI Karate),
        founded by four directors - Shihan B. Duraivelu, Shihan G. Gajendran,

        Our Journey: From 2011 to MKAI Karate Meishin Karate Association of
        Integrity (MKAI) was officially founded in 2025 by Sensei K. Manikandan
        (4th Dan, Karate India Organisation – National Judge), who serves as the
        President and Founder of MKAI Karate. However, the journey began much
        earlier. Sensei K. Manikandan started conducting karate classes in 2011
        in Kolathur, training students with dedication and passion. What began
        as a small group of committed learners gradually evolved into a strong
        and disciplined karate community. <br></br>
        <br></br>Our dojo began in Kolathur in 2011, where each class focused on
        building skill, confidence, and self-discipline. Through continuous
        dedication and a commitment to quality training, MKAI Karate has
        steadily grown and now serves students across multiple branches
        throughout Tamil Nadu. With a vision to promote Karate as a way of life,
        MKAI is committed to nurturing discipline, confidence, respect, and
        strong character in practitioners of all ages.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As the guiding force behind MKAI Karate, Sensei Manikandan brings years
        of experience in both traditional and competitive karate. He emphasizes
        technical excellence, mental strength, and leadership development,
        inspiring students to achieve their full potential both on and off the
        mat.

        and soft techniques, Seigokan Goju-Ryu emphasizes powerful strikes,
        close-range defence, breathing control, and mental discipline. Training
        is rooted in Kihon (basics), Kata (forms), and Kumite (sparring),
        ensuring the holistic development of both body and mind.
